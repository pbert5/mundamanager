## How to Contribute as a Developper?

### Practical steps to create a pull request

1. Clone the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Added some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push -u origin HEAD`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### How to Setup your Environment

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Node.js 18+
   - Supabase project url and key
   - Cloudflare Turnstile keys

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Configure the following variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=mundamanager-project-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=mundamanager-turnstile-key
   TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=mundamanager-turnstile-secret-key
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

3. **Running the environment**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Mobile device testing**

   `npm run dev` already listens on the LAN. The startup log prints a **Network** URL (for example `http://192.168.1.115:3000`). Open that URL on a phone on the same Wi-Fi.

   Next.js still blocks HMR and other `/_next` assets from that origin until you allow it in `next.config.js`:

   ```js
   allowedDevOrigins: ['192.168.1.115'],
   ```

   Use the same IP as the Network URL, then restart the dev server. If you skip this, the page may load but you will see `Blocked cross-origin request to Next.js dev resource` in the terminal.

   Do not commit this `next.config.js` change when you push. `allowedDevOrigins` is your local IP and should stay off the repo.

5. **Access to the DB Schema**
   The Supabase DB schema can be accessed through https://supabase-schema.vercel.app/
   Use the Supabase URL and the and the anon key to connect to it

### Standalone local startup with Docker Compose

Run Munda Manager and a fresh local Supabase stack without relying on a parent
repository, host Node installation, or hosted Supabase project. This flow is
supported on Linux because both Compose services use the host network: the
Supabase CLI creates its own Docker containers and the app reaches them at
`127.0.0.1:54321`.

**Prerequisites:** Docker Engine with the Compose plugin, and a checkout of
this repository. The Docker daemon must be reachable through
`/var/run/docker.sock`.

1. Copy the environment example and add any app-specific values you need:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
2. Start the complete standalone stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f compose.standalone.yaml up --build
   ```
3. Open [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000). The Supabase CLI
   service starts first, builds the committed schema and seed data, and writes
   its generated local URL and anon key to the ignored `.env.standalone` file.

Stop the app with `Ctrl-C`, then stop and remove the local containers with:
```bash
docker compose -f compose.standalone.yaml down
```

To rebuild the local database, run the same startup command after `down`; for
an explicit destructive reset while the stack is running, use:
```bash
docker compose -f compose.standalone.yaml run --rm supabase supabase db reset --workdir /workspace
```

The Compose wrapper builds the pinned Supabase CLI in a small helper image and
mounts the Docker socket because `supabase start` manages
the database/API containers itself; it does not expose additional host ports
and does not use any parent-repository files.

### Manual local Supabase development

The standalone Compose flow above is the supported startup path. If you already
have the Supabase CLI and Node installed, the underlying commands are still
available for incremental development:

> **Why are local migrations disabled in config.toml?**
> The files in `supabase/migrations/` are *incremental* deltas for developers
> who already have the full database — they assume base tables that were never
> captured as a migration, so replaying them from empty crashes. Local migration
> auto-run is therefore disabled in `supabase/config.toml`. Instead, `supabase start`
> and `supabase db reset` natively build the fresh local database via `[db.seed].sql_paths`
> in `supabase/config.toml`, loading the committed schema snapshot (`schema.public.sql`),
> helper schemas, role grants, triggers, and game reference data (`seed.sql`) in the exact right order.

**Prerequisites:** [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli), Docker
(for the local stack), and a `psql` client.

1. **Bootstrap the database** from the repo root:
   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```
   Or if the stack is already running and you want to clean/rebuild your local database from scratch:
   ```bash
   supabase db reset
   ```
   Supabase CLI natively resets the database and seeds the schema snapshot (`schema.public.sql`), helper schemas, role grants, triggers, and game reference data (`seed.sql`).

2. **Point `.env.local` at the local stack.** Run `supabase status` to get the local API URL and anon key, then set:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon key from `supabase status`>
   ```

3. **Start the app** with `npm run dev` as usual.

**Notes**
- `supabase db reset` wipes the local database, rebuilds it cleanly from the daily production schema snapshot, and seeds reference game lookup data.
- The email webhook is intentionally **not** part of local setup: it needs AWS
  SES secrets and only matters for outbound notification email. See
  `supabase/webhooks/README.md` if you need it.
- To pull the latest production schema before bootstrapping, `git pull` first —
  `schema.public.sql` is refreshed by CI daily.

## Fighter Effects System

### Overview
The fighter effects system manages all modifications to fighter statistics through a unified interface. Effects can come from various sources:
- Lasting Injuries
- Advancements
- Bionics
- Cyberteknika
- Gene-smithing
- Rig-glitches
- Power-boosts (Spyrer enhancements)
- Augmentations
- Equipment
- Skills
- Vehicle Lasting Damages
- User modifications

### Data Structure
```typescript
// Core effect interface
interface FighterEffect {
  id?: string;
  effect_name: string;
  fighter_effect_modifiers: Array<{
    id: string;
    fighter_effect_id: string;
    stat_name: string;
    numeric_value: number;
  }>;
}

// Fighter effects structure
interface Fighter {
  effects: {
    injuries: FighterEffect[];
    advancements: FighterEffect[];
    bionics: FighterEffect[];
    cyberteknika: FighterEffect[];
    'gene-smithing': FighterEffect[];
    'rig-glitches': FighterEffect[];
    'power-boosts': FighterEffect[];
    augmentations: FighterEffect[];
    equipment: FighterEffect[];
    skills: FighterEffect[];
    vehicle_damages: FighterEffect[];
    user: FighterEffect[];
  }
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Effect Categories**
   - Each effect belongs to a specific category (injury, advancement, vehicle damage, etc.)
   - Categories are stored in the `fighter_effect_categories` table
   - Each category can have different business rules and UI treatments

2. **Stat Modifications**
   - Effects modify fighter stats through `fighter_effect_modifiers`
   - Each modifier specifies:
     - Which stat to modify (`stat_name`)
     - How much to modify it by (`numeric_value`)
     - Reference to its parent effect (`fighter_effect_id`)

3. **Stat Calculation**
   ```typescript
   function calculateAdjustedStats(fighter: Fighter) {
     // Start with base stats
     const adjustedStats = { ...fighter.base_stats };

     // Process all effect categories
     ['injuries', 'advancements', 'bionics', 'cyberteknika', 'gene-smithing', 'rig-glitches', 'power-boosts', 'augmentations', 'equipment', 'skills', 'vehicle_damages', 'user'].forEach(category => {
       fighter.effects[category]?.forEach(effect => {
         effect.fighter_effect_modifiers?.forEach(modifier => {
           const statName = modifier.stat_name.toLowerCase();
           adjustedStats[statName] += modifier.numeric_value;
         });
       });
     });

     return adjustedStats;
   }
   ```

4. **Database Schema**
   ```sql
   -- Effect categories
   CREATE TABLE fighter_effect_categories (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     category_name TEXT NOT NULL,
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
     updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
   );

   -- Effects
   CREATE TABLE fighter_effects (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     fighter_id UUID REFERENCES fighters(id),
     vehicle_id UUID REFERENCES vehicles(id),
     effect_name TEXT NOT NULL,
     category_id UUID REFERENCES fighter_effect_categories(id),
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );

   -- Effect modifiers
   CREATE TABLE fighter_effect_modifiers (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     fighter_effect_id UUID REFERENCES fighter_effects(id),
     stat_name TEXT NOT NULL,
     numeric_value INTEGER NOT NULL
   );
   ```

### Key Files for Effect Logic

The fighter effects system is implemented across several key files:

#### Core Effect Processing
- **`utils/effect-modifiers.ts`**: Core logic for applying effect modifiers to fighter stats
  - `calculateAdjustedStats()`: Main function that processes all effect categories
  - `applyWeaponModifiers()`: Applies equipment-to-equipment effects on weapon profiles
  - Supports both 'add' and 'set' operations for stat modifications

#### Data Fetching
- **`app/lib/shared/fighter-data.ts`**: Server-side functions for fetching fighter data
  - `getFighterEffects()`: Queries and groups effects by category from database
  - Returns effects organized by category: `{ injuries: [], equipment: [], skills: [], ... }`
  - Uses caching with proper cache tags for performance

#### Type Definitions
- **`types/fighter.ts`**: TypeScript interfaces for fighter data
  - `FighterEffect`: Interface for individual effects
  - `FighterProps.effects`: Complete effects structure with all categories
  - `EffectCategory`: Union type of all valid effect categories

#### Frontend Components
- **`components/fighter/fighter-details-card.tsx`**: Displays fighter stats with effects applied on the fighter detail page
  - Receives effects from parent via props
  - Constructs `fighterData` object with all effect categories (line 284-294)
  - Calls `calculateAdjustedStats()` to compute modified stats (line 344-347)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Must include all effect categories in the `fighterData.effects` object

- **`components/gang/fighter-card.tsx`**: Displays fighter stats with effects applied on the gang roster
  - Used in gang page to show fighter cards in the roster
  - Constructs `fighterData` object with all effect categories (line 249-260)
  - Calls `calculateAdjustedStats()` to compute modified stats (line 296)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Must include all effect categories in the `fighterData.effects` object (same as fighter-details-card)

- **`components/fighter/fighter-page.tsx`**: Main fighter page component
  - Fetches initial fighter data including effects
  - Transforms and passes effects to child components (line 215-226)
  - Manages fighter state and updates

#### Effect Application Logic
- **`app/actions/equipment.ts`**: Handles equipment purchases and associated effects
  - `buyEquipmentForFighter()`: Automatically creates fighter_effects when equipment with effects is purchased
  - Queries `fighter_effect_types` to find effects associated with equipment
  - Creates both `fighter_effects` and `fighter_effect_modifiers` records

- **`app/actions/fighter-advancement.ts`**: Handles skill advancements and associated effects
  - `addSkillAdvancement()`: Automatically creates fighter_effects when skills with effects are added (line 325-373)
  - Queries `fighter_effect_types` where `type_specific_data->>'skill_id'` matches
  - Creates both `fighter_effects` and `fighter_effect_modifiers` records
  - Invalidates caches to trigger re-rendering

### Usage Examples

1. **Adding an Injury**
   ```typescript
   const injury: FighterEffect = {
     effect_name: "Head Wound",
     fighter_effect_modifiers: [{

       numeric_value: -1
     }]
   };
   fighter.effects.injuries.push(injury);
   ```

2. **Adding a Bionic Enhancement**

     }]
   };
   fighter.effects.bionics.push(bionic);
   ```

3. **Adding Equipment Effects**

         numeric_value: 1
       }
     ]
   };
   fighter.effects.skills.push(skillEffect);
   ```

5. **Adding a Power Boost (Spyrer)**
   ```typescript
   const powerBoost: FighterEffect = {
     effect_name: "Improved Motive Power",
     fighter_effect_modifiers: [{
       stat_name: "movement",
       numeric_value: 1
     }],
     type_specific_data: {
       kill_cost: 4,
       credits_increase: 10
     }
   };
   fighter.effects['power-boosts'].push(powerBoost);
   ```

6. **Adding a Vehicle Lasting Damage**

       numeric_value: -1
     }]
   };
   fighter.effects.vehicle_damages.push(vehicleDamage);
   ```

7. **User Modification**
   ```typescript
   const userMod: FighterEffect = {
     effect_name: "Custom Bonus",

       numeric_value: 1
     }]
   };
   fighter.effects.user.push(userMod);
   ```

## Gang Logging System

### Overview
The gang logging system provides comprehensive tracking of all changes and activities within your gang. Every action is automatically logged with timestamps, creating a complete audit trail of your gang's history.

### Features
- **Automatic Logging**: All gang activities are tracked automatically through database triggers
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Logs credits, reputation, fighters, equipment, vehicles, and more
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Human-readable log entries with before/after values
- **Real-time Updates**: Logs appear immediately after actions are performed
- **Paginated Display**: Clean interface with 10 logs per page for easy browsing

### Logged Activities

#### Gang Changes
- **Credits**: "Credits increased from 500 to 600" or "Credits decreased from 600 to 500"
- **Reputation**: "Reputation changed from 5 to 10"
- **Resources**: Meat and exploration points changes
- **Gang Type**: Gang alignment and type modifications

#### Fighter Operations
- **Fighter Management**: "Added fighter 'Juve' (65 credits). New gang rating: 365"
- **Fighter Removal**: "Removed fighter 'Ganger' (95 credits). New gang rating: 270"
- **Status Changes**: Fighter deaths, retirements, enslavement with context
- **Cost Adjustments**: Manual fighter cost modifications
- **Experience & Kills**: XP gains and kill count changes

#### Equipment Transactions
- **Purchases**: "Fighter 'Ganger' bought Lasgun for 15 credits. New gang rating: 280"
- **Sales**: "Fighter 'Heavy' sold Plasma gun for 100 credits. New gang rating: 380"
- **Stash Operations**: 
  - "Fighter moved Heavy bolter to gang stash. New gang rating: 265"
  - "Fighter took Plasma gun from gang stash. New gang rating: 365"

#### Vehicle Operations
- **Vehicle Management**: "Added vehicle 'Cargo-8 Ridgehauler' (130 credits). New gang rating: 495"
- **Vehicle Equipment**: "Vehicle 'Ridgehauler' bought Heavy bolter for 160 credits. New gang rating: 655"
- **Vehicle Modifications**: Upgrades, repairs, and customizations

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Triggers
The logging system uses PostgreSQL triggers that fire automatically on data changes:

```sql
-- Gang changes trigger
CREATE TRIGGER gang_changes_trigger
    AFTER UPDATE ON gangs
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION auto_log_gang_changes();

-- Fighter changes trigger
CREATE TRIGGER fighter_changes_trigger
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON fighters
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION fighter_logs();
```

#### Smart Duplicate Prevention
The system prevents duplicate logging by checking for recent related activities:
- Credit decreases from equipment purchases don't create separate credit logs
- Fighter additions don't duplicate credit change logs
- Equipment stash operations are distinguished from regular sales/purchases

#### Data Structure
```typescript
interface GangLog {
  id: string;
  gang_id: string;
  user_id: string;
  action_type: string;
  description: string;
  fighter_id?: string;
  vehicle_id?: string;
  created_at: string;
}
```

### User Interface
- **Modal Display**: Logs open in a responsive modal dialog
- **Table Format**: Clean 3-column layout (Date, Type, Description)
- **Pagination**: Navigate through logs with page controls
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing
- **Real-time Updates**: New logs appear immediately without page refresh

### Access
Gang logs are accessible via the "Logs" button on each gang page, positioned next to the Edit button. The logs are private to the gang owner and provide a complete history of all gang activities.

## Notification System

### Overview
The notification system provides real-time notifications to users for various application events. Notifications support different types (info, warning, error, invite) with appropriate visual indicators.

### Features
- Real-time notifications using Supabase Realtime
- Different notification types with distinct visual styling
- Automatic marking of notifications as read when viewed
- Notification deletion capability
- Database-driven notification storage

### Data Structure
```typescript
// Core notification interface
interface Notification {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  type: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'invite' | 'campaign_invite' | 'friend_request' | 'battle_invite' | 'gang_invite';
  created_at: string;
  dismissed: boolean;
  link: string | null;
}
```

### Database Integration
- Notifications are stored in the `notifications` table
- Database triggers automatically create notifications for specific events
- Example functions:
  - `notify_campaign_member_added()`: Creates notifications when users are invited to campaigns
- Example triggers:
  - `trigger_campaign_member_notification`: Fires the notification function when new campaign members are added

### Implementation
- Global notification store manages application-wide notification state
- Notification hooks provide real-time updates and management functions
- Notification API endpoints for secure server-side operations
- Profile page integration for reviewing all notifications

## Data Architecture

```typescript
// Core Data Types
interface GangData {
  id: string
  name: string
  credits: number
  reputation: number
  alignment: 'Law Abiding' | 'Outlaw'
  meat: number

  advancements: Advancement
}
```



## Self-Hosted Caching (Coolify)

On Vercel the app uses Next's built-in Data Cache and nothing here applies. When
self-hosting, `cache-handler.js` can back the Next.js `cacheHandler` with Redis so
cached data is shared between instances and survives a redeploy.

It is off unless `USE_REDIS_CACHE=true` is set **at build time** — `next.config.js`
reads it to decide whether to register the handler at all. `REDIS_URL` is a runtime
secret and is deliberately not needed during `next build`; without it the handler
falls back to an in-process cache, which is what makes the build work.

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `USE_REDIS_CACHE` | build | `true` enables the handler |
| `REDIS_URL` | runtime | Secret. Absent ⇒ in-memory fallback |
| `REDIS_CACHE_PREFIX` | no | Default `munda-manager:next-cache` |
| `REDIS_CACHE_TIMEOUT_MS` | no | Default `1000` |
| `NEXT_PRIVATE_DEBUG_CACHE` | no | `1` logs HIT/MISS/SET and invalidations |

### Redis instance requirements

**Configure the instance as a cache, not a store:**

```
maxmemory 256mb                 # size to taste
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
```

Cache entries carry no TTL on purpose, so that tag invalidation stays the only thing
that expires them. On Redis's actual default policy (`noeviction`) the keyspace
therefore grows unbounded until writes fail with OOM — at which point the cache stops
working and invalidations start being dropped. Under `allkeys-lru` it just evicts, which
is the failure mode the handler is designed around.

**Recovery after a Redis outage.** Cache entries have no TTL, so an invalidation that
cannot reach Redis would otherwise leave stale data that nothing expires. If that
happens the handler marks the cache dirty: it stops serving Redis hits, and once Redis
is reachable again it drops the whole namespace before trusting it. Expect one cold
cache — and a burst of Supabase reads — after an outage. Both transitions are logged.

**Do not expose the instance.** Entries hold whatever `unstable_cache` wrapped — gang,
fighter and campaign data, profiles, permission results — so treat it like any other
datastore with real data in it: private network only, and require auth (and TLS) if it
is ever reachable beyond the Coolify network.

`unstable_cache` entries are stored under `…:v1:fetch:` and persist across deploys;
rendered pages are stored per build id so a new build never serves the previous
build's payloads. Tags from `utils/cache-tags.ts` are indexed as Redis sets, so
`revalidateTag` deletes exactly the affected keys rather than scanning the keyspace.

To confirm Redis is receiving entries:

```bash
redis-cli -u "$REDIS_URL" DBSIZE
redis-cli -u "$REDIS_URL" --scan --pattern 'munda-manager:next-cache:*' | head -50
redis-cli -u "$REDIS_URL" SMEMBERS 'munda-manager:next-cache:v1:tag:gang-<GANG_ID>'
redis-cli -u "$REDIS_URL" MONITOR   # watch live traffic while browsing

# flush the app's cache (e.g. after changing the shape of a cached value)
redis-cli -u "$REDIS_URL" --scan --pattern 'munda-manager:next-cache:*' \
  | xargs -r -n 500 redis-cli -u "$REDIS_URL" DEL
```

To roll back to stock Next.js caching, unset `USE_REDIS_CACHE` and rebuild.
